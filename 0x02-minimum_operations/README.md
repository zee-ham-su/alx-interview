# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Description
This directory contains the solution for the "Minimum Operations" problem.

## Requirements
## General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be documented
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable

## Problem Statement
Given a number `n`, the goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to obtain `n` characters using only two operations:
1. Copy all the characters.
2. Paste the copied characters.

- Prototype: def minOperations(n)
- Returns an integer
- If n is impossible to achieve, return 0

## Files
- `0-main.py`: Main Python script to test the solution.
- `0-minoperations.py`: Python module containing the function `minOperations(n: int) -> int` that calculates the minimum number of operations required to obtain `n` characters.

## Usage
To test the solution, run the following command: ./0-main.py
