# N Queens

This directory contains the solution for the N Queens problem.

## Problem Description

The N Queens problem is a classic puzzle where the goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.
