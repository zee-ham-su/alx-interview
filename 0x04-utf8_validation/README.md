## Requirements
To complete this project, you will need the following:
## General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable



## Files
- `0-validate_utf8.py`: Contains the implementation of the `valid_utf8` function.
- `0-main.py`: Contains unit tests for the `valid_utf8` function.

## Usage
To use the `valid_utf8` function, import it from `utf8_validation.py` and pass a list of integers representing the data set to be validated. The function will return `True` if the data set is a valid UTF-8 encoding, and `False` otherwise.
